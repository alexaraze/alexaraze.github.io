                <h4>Ulises Carrion</h4>
                <h5>Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h5>
                <p>I was quite drawn to Carrión's description of mail art as not being a singular thing, but rather the coupling between art (something we create; an entity) and mail (this larger network that exists beyond our control). In this way, this physical communication system of sender/receiver nodes and messages acts as a "rhizome," branching out without a clear centre in the same way the internet does with its network of users (the AOL "you've got mail!" alert is ringing in my ears).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But I have to say, I'm not totally sold on Carrión’s definition of the postal system as a support rather than part of the medium itself, especially given his argument that this is the case because an artist doesn't need to understand how it functions. There are plenty of art forms that include, or even rely on, a lack of understanding of the media (e.g. generative AI art that thrills in spontaneous/unexpected output). Plus, as a Canadian with a technocultural studies degree, you know I love me a little Marshall McLuhan. So I have to argue that the medium is the message here—both content and communication system are enveloped within the art form. And if the medium is the massage, the very fact that we are oblivious to the inner workings of the system is also an inseparable component of the work.</p>

                <h4>Laurel Schwulst & Edouard U</h4>
                <h5>Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h5>
                <p>I never realized how the metaphor of the internet as a cloud actually played into the tech sublime—separating us from the source, and making the web feel like this awe-fully complex thing that we can't even begin to comprehend, let alone control.
                    I loved the alternate comparison of a website to one of many plants in a garden. Each as a distinct life that can be nurtured or grow wild, but collectively making up a (horti)culture, weaving through each other, cross-pollinating in unexpected, beautiful, chaotic ways. This passage honestly just gave me such reassurance about my own portfolio website. I've had a domain sitting dormant for over a year now—every time I try to start building the site, I just become paralyzed by the task. Should I redesign the layout? Maybe I should wait until I have better assets? What if it's not perfect? Better not to start.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The visual of gentle, gradual gardening is freeing—don't rush the plant, just sow the seed and see how it grows. Although to be fair, when Schwulst says she hopes people "steer the web back to its own original architecture" by having their own websites, I'm not so sure she was referring to portfolios...can a site designed as a corporate/capitalist portal to get hired count as a subversive act?

                <h4>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer</h4>
                <h5>Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h5>
                <p>Interesting how Ludovico rejects the view of analogue and digital being at an odds with one another, instead arguing for a relationship that is bidirectional in nature—one informing the user experience or interface, and the other the content and social interaction. But I wonder how a true "hybrid" form of zines or activist content can actually manifest in our digital culture (can it be real? can it be effective?). Especially as Ludovico seems to suggest that activist media should only exist outside of the confines of established networks such as Google, Twitter, or Facebook. Is it better to have a pure radical message seen only by a few or a diluted one that is disseminated to many? I would love to see an example of content that does not need to make that compromise.</p>

                <h5>STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h5>
                <p>It's actually quite beautiful how the collapse of Geocities resulted in a domino effect of other sites/communities (e.g. Tripod) being affected. It speaks to the motif of the internet as an ever-entangled web—even deletion (death) cannot happen in isolation. It's crazy to think how a seemingly arbitrary choice such as selecting a hosting platform for your website can have "life or death" consequences. We place so much unfounded trust in these companies that structure and store our data as if they're eternal entities; it feels like they've always been here, and always will be ("once on the internet, always on the internet," right?). I wonder what the digital ruins of today will be, written about in articles 20 years from now...</p>

                <h4>Seth Price</h4>
                <h5>Dispersion</h5>
                <p>I found it very interesting how Price describes conceptual art as being "radically incomplete," as if a piece can only truly become a finished work in relation to its context, distribution, and perception, rather than merely the artist's intent and the creation itself. In particular, I feel like this argument has widened my perspective on works like Duchamp's Fountain. I always assumed that the classic Dadaist piece was famous purely because of shock value, the absurdity of poking fun at how a urinal can be rebranded as art; how a signature can add cultural/financial value to a bottom-of-the-barrel object. And in this way, I saw it as alienating people who don't "understand" art and may just see a stupidly expensive pisspot, as if the work is solely catered to those "arrogant, parasitical, self-styled elite" who have the luxury of debating what is or isn't high culture. But Price's point about dispersion being part of the artwork made me realize that I might have misunderstood a key aspect of the piece. By using a household object to ground the conceptual art into everyday reality, Fountain is actually made more accessible to its audience. You don't even need to see it in person to have all the information you need to form an opinion—anyone and everyone is invited to comment, whether in praise or scathing critique.</p>

                <h4>Ben Duvall</h4>
                <h5>Selections from New Modernism(s)</h5>
                <p>This reading made me think of meme culture. Duvall describes how semiotics evolved throughout cultural epochs—in a hypermodernist model, signs become layered with signified within themselves; the 'surface' of the internet has increasingly fragmented and abstracted sign systems. Memes seem like the perfect example of this. You start with a simple cultural reference with an image and text (or video and voice, etc). That message is shared and enjoyed, but then it quickly proliferates—people begin making variations, the references become looser, there become meta-memes of meta-memes. It gets to the point where the message becomes so far removed from the first meme, that you have to have followed its full evolution ("be in the know") to have a chance of understanding the reference anymore. And eventually it becomes too saturated, people get bored. The signified is too obvious, the joke is dead. The cycle must begin again with the birth of a new abstraction.

                <h5>"A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h5>
                <p>I completely support the pursuit of identifying implicit biases within any cultural/communicative context, so I don't mean to sound dismissive/invalidate when I say that nothing is new here. The challenges in creating a non-eurocentric coding language simply mirror the same biases, hierarchies, and language barriers we already encounter in our everyday non-digital lives. So naturally, none of these programming-related solutions are satisfying at all. We're just stuck trying to fix a broken system with the same broken pieces. How do we truly bridge this gap and create a programming world that's genuinely equitable? Vive la révolution? I'm frustrated that the answer to cultural problems always seems to ultimately come down to full-scale mobilization, some sort of moment of salvation where we expunge millennia of white supremacy/colonialism/oppression. It feels like a fantasy—noble, but futile.</p>

                <h4>Paul Soulellis</h4>
                <h5>Performing the Feed</h5>
                <p>One of my favourite readings so far. I was particularly interested in this idea of the feed creating a " flowing state of new boredom semi-awareness, something that feels like a texture." I think that perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to sink into a doom scroll—I often myself scrolling through tiktok with eyes glazed over, half-consciously swiping through videos in the hopes of finding one that is so entertaining, such a wild spectacle, that it pulls me out of that state into full consciousness. And although I don't often watch them, I also find the concept of livestreams so fascinating. Live shopping has become a huge trend on tiktok (and specialized live shopping apps) where people tune into a stream and place their orders live, like a new-wave web version of QVC. It seems to defy the idea that people demand instant gratification in this hyper-tech age; that people want what they want, when they want it. Maybe we're looking for ways to slow down?</p>

                <h5>Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h5>
                <p>Very loose thoughts, memories, connections for this week's reading:
                    I took a technoculture course in undergrad (back in 2017) called Race, Class & Political Power, where we analyzed media related to technology and racial politics. The Way's train route reminded me of our class viewing of Ava DuVernay's 13th, cataloguing how white supremacy has never faded, only metastasizing over time from slavery to segregation to mass incarceration. We then connected 13th to the documentary Do Not Resist, which extrapolates this concept into the digital world through an exploration of how police departments have become further militarized across rural America, and how algorithms are now used to predict criminal behaviour and even inform the severity of sentencing (Minority Report, anyone?). And surprise, surprise, Black people are predicted by these AI models to be the most dangerous and likely to commit repeat crimes. Also reminded me of my lawyer friend who was completing her thesis on AI in law, and was lamenting to me about how even dedicated attempts to eradicate prejudice in the legal system end up being informed by racial biases (e.g. if you remove race as a factor in a populations study, the algorithm will instead substitute postal/zip codes which are able to predict where racialized communities live).
                <br>
                <br>
                But with an understanding that our system is fundamentally flawed, the lingering question I'm left with is: if The Beyond is all about community, is it enough to carve out a small safe bubble for yourself (and your people) within the system and simply enjoy the peace, or does this imply a necessary act of collective rebellion/mobilization? If the latter, then if Assata Shakur's theory (which she documents in her brilliant biography, Assata) that true social revolution can only be achieved through slow, careful implementation, it’s a huge problem that our modern-day movements call for mass inclusion rather than strategic mobilization. To take an intersectional approach and apply this to the feminist movement, I'm reminded of the bell hooks quote: "The 'anything goes' approach to the definition of the word [feminism] has rendered it practically meaningless...this definition of feminism is almost apolitical in tone...." In this sense, we need to be very careful about who we are allowing into our community in The Beyond.

                <h5>Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think</h5>
                <p>When asking the question of "can creatives think?," do we have a firm understanding of what exactly creativity is (or what thinking entails)? Like, is creativity the ability to generate novel ideas? Because it's arguable that every single piece of art/philosophy/thought in history simply builds upon or combines works of its predecessors—is it even possible to come up with a thought that is wholly original? So then if it's not about originality, is creativity the ability to form connections between those preexisting works, weaving new insights from these patterns? If that's the case, machines are every bit as (if not more) capable of creative thought as humans. Even in the strawberries and cream analogy, Turing assumes that machines can't bond over a shared love for a flavour in the way that humans can. But what does it mean to bond? Or to enjoy flavour? What's the problem if a machine mimics a feeling/preference/emotion to create a bond with you, as if humans aren't also simply mimicking the behaviour of those around them? Isn't a brain just as fickle, just as prone to mis-mapping correlations, just as likely to use historical/contextual data to generate ideas in the same way as a machine? What is it about creativity that makes people assume it's a uniquely human trait?</p>
